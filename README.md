# Analysis-of-Congestive_heart_failure

Aim: The main objective is to find the highest re-admission rate among all the factors.

Description: 

Hospital re-admission remains a continued challenge in the case of heart failure patient. So, in this project we have analyse how many people belonging to different age groups have got re-admitted. And also we have analysed which disease is occurring maximum at which age group. We have done prediction by using linear regression between age and duration of stay to find out the maximum readmission rate.

Data Analysis:

It is a process of cleaning, modelling and transforming the useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision making.
Here we have plotted a graph where X-axis shows the people above age 50 and Y-axis showsnumber of people in each age group who are above 50.Here we have found out the number of patients getting readmitted who are above the age of 50.We can see that there are many patients above the age of 50. This is because the majority of the patients who are diagnosed with Heart Failure are aged.

Here we have plotted the graph rep resenting the age group in the X-axis and the duration ofstay for each age group in the Y-axis. From our result we can say that the Duration of stay is longest for the age group 61-70.


The graph represents the ages that are above 50 on the X-axis and the diseases on the Yaxis.The diseases are represented in the form of 1,2 and 3. Here 1 represents that “the patient has the disease”, 2 represents that “the patient doesn’t have the disease” and 3 represents that “the data is not available”. We can see that according to our graph the disease that occurred the most is Diastolic_HeartFailure.


Prediction:

  we have done logistic regression because the data set contains categorical variables to find out the readmission rate we find out the accuracy score.
